                <p class="mt-2">Having worked in the accounting profession for many years, I have found that the best way to help clients is to get to know them and to help them deal with their problems as they arise, rather than trying to sort the problem out once it has happened.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">It is all a question of being proactive for clients, who in the small and medium size of business need all the help and guidance they can get, especially during these current financial times.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">My expertise is in using the current tax rules and regulations to maximise profit extraction and minimise tax payments. The clients currently and previously looked after cover a large range of sectors and sizes which has enabled me to develop a vast amount of relevant business knowledge.</p>
                <p class="mt-2">If you want to contact me then my telephone number is <a href="tel:01604620106" class="text-brand-yellow hover:underline">01604 620106</a>.</p>
                <p class="mt-2"><strong>Specialties:</strong> Accountancy and tax advice for small and medium sized business, especially helping with new start ups and helping the owners of small business have someone to talk too and figure out what is good for each person with regards to the ever changing tax and accounting regulations.</p>
